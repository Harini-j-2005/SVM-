# Text Classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This project implements a **text classification system** using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and **TF-IDF feature extraction**.  
The trained model is deployed as a **Flask web application** that classifies user-input text into predefined categories in real time.

## 📌 Project Overview

Text classification is a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) task used in applications such as:
- News article categorization
- Spam detection
- Customer feedback analysis

This project uses a **Linear SVM**, which performs efficiently on high-dimensional and sparse text data.
